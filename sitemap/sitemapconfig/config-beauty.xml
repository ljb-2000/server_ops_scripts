  <!-- ********************************************************
          FILTERS

  Filters specify wild-card patterns that the script compares
  against all URLs it finds.  Filters can be used to exclude
  certain URLs from your Sitemap, for instance if you have
  hidden content that you hope the search engines don't find.

  Filters can be either type="wildcard", which means standard
  path wildcards (* and ?) are used to compare against URLs,
  or type="regexp", which means regular expressions are used
  to compare.

  Filters are applied in the order specified in this file.

  An action="drop" filter causes exclusion of matching URLs.
  An action="pass" filter causes inclusion of matching URLs,
  shortcutting any other later filters that might also match.
  If no filter at all matches a URL, the URL will be included.
  Together you can build up fairly complex rules.

  The default action is "drop".
  The default type is "wildcard".

  You can MODIFY or DELETE these entries as appropriate for
  your site.  However, unlike above, the example entries in
  this section are not contrived and may be useful to you as
  they are.

  <!-- Exclude URLs within UNIX-style hidden files or directories       -->
